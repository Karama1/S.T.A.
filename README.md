How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

When building code, it's important to debug it before you run anything else. This is the first process when making sure it's functional and secured the way you've coded it. After this, you can do some JUnit testing to ensure it's secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

With user needs, I go by exactly what's labeled. If the user wants program do to "x", then I'll make it so the program can only do "x," unless there's extra that necessary with the project to be considered completed.
I typically do this for everything as it makes it simplified and easier for me go work through the process of completeing projects.

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I like to do what's absolutely necessary before anything else. I like to consider this to be the base of the software. Once the necessities are done, I'll expand on it and work towards making the program function smoothly without errors.
